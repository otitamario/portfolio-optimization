# portfolio-optimization

The solution to the problem is in a Python notebook.

For this I created a docker container with jupyter lab installed, where you can view and test the notebook.

To run the container run: docker compose up -d

After that, just access the browser: localhost:8888

The notebook desafio.ipynb is in the work folder

To stop the container run: docker compose down
